# asciidoctor-github-pages-sample

This project illustrates how to build a Github pages website using Asciidoctor and Travis-CI.

The generation is placed in module `doc` so that it can depend on some other module being built
to include snippets of documentation generated at build time.

The generated Github Pages website is available here :
